# Continuation Prompt for Next Copilot Session

**Copy and paste this prompt to continue:**

---

I have an established automated version management system for a C# Subnautica mod project. The foundation is complete with:

✅ 100% deterministic builds verified (129 mods)
✅ Hash-based version tracking system (`manage-versions.ps1`) 
✅ Clean JSON baseline with current state (`mod-versions.json`)
✅ Enhanced build scripts with selective configuration support
✅ SSH authentication configured and baseline pushed to GitHub

**Current Status**: The local system works perfectly - can detect changes, increment versions, and track hashes. The baseline is live on GitHub at `MrPurple6411/UnifiedVSSolution`.

**Next Goal**: Implement the online component of the auto-versioning system that:

1. **Fetches the `mod-versions.json` from GitHub** (online baseline)
2. **Compares local DLL hashes vs online baseline** 
3. **Auto-increments versions** for changed mods
4. **Triggers selective rebuilds** (only changed configurations)
5. **Commits and pushes** updated version file automatically

This will complete the original request: *"are the builds deterministic? if we wanted to setup a hash checking system to check versions for whats on the repo and if the hash of a mod is not the same as online it increments the mod version automatically"*

**Working Directory**: `c:\Repos\MrPurple6411\UnifiedSubnautica`

**Key Files**:
- `manage-versions.ps1` - Needs GitHub API integration functions
- `build-all.ps1` - Ready for selective rebuilds
- `mod-versions.json` - Perfect baseline established
- `SESSION-STATUS.md` - Full project status and context

Please help me implement the GitHub API integration and automated rebuild workflow to complete this automated version management system.
